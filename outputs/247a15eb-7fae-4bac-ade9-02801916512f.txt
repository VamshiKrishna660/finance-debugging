I understand that you cannot access the financial document due to the missing `pypdf` package. I need the content of the financial document to perform the comprehensive risk assessment you requested.

Please provide the content of the financial document directly, or ensure the `pypdf` package is installed so I can access it.

Once I have the document's content, I will proceed with the detailed risk assessment, including:

*   **Overall Risk Rating:** A justified rating (Low/Medium/High).
*   **Risk Category Breakdown:** Severity levels for financial, market, operational, and regulatory risks.
*   **Key Risk Indicators:** Identification and current status.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Best case, base case, and worst-case scenarios.
*   **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Recommendations for managing identified risks.
*   **Stress Test Considerations:** Areas to focus on for stress testing.
*   **Ongoing Monitoring Suggestions:** Key metrics and factors for continuous oversight.

I am ready to generate the report as soon as the necessary information is available.
